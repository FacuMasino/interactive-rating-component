## My process

As mentioned in the style-guide I first started with the HTML structure of the solution, then the CSS/SASS coding. For the SASS code I used a very simple structure which consists in 4 files: base, components, layouts and main.

- base: contains resets, variables, mixins and utility classes.
- components: resuable classes.
- layout: the CSS that handles the layout, the main structure.
- main: contain the imports for all the files.

Also I used normalize.css for handling all the resets and avoid typical problems with browsers compatibility.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Normalize.css
- JavaScript
